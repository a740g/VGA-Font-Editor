# VGA FONT EDITOR

This is a cross-platform editor and library for VGA ROM fonts. This has code for rendering text using a loaded font. The source code is written in [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe) and works natively without using any third party libraries. Selecting and editing using the mouse is supported.

## What is a VGA ROM font?

These are fonts that are embedded in the VGA ROM BIOS. To learn more about VGA ROM fonts see:

- [VGA Fonts](https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Fonts)

## How is a character stored in memory?

It's quite simple, 0 encodes background, 1 encodes foreground color. VGA fonts are always 8 bits wide so that each byte contains exactly one row. For letter 'A' in the typical 8x16 font it would be (in binary):

```text
00000000b  byte  0
00000000b  byte  1
00000000b  byte  2
00010000b  byte  3
00111000b  byte  4
01101100b  byte  5
11000110b  byte  6
11000110b  byte  7
11111110b  byte  8
11000110b  byte  9
11000110b  byte 10
11000110b  byte 11
11000110b  byte 12
00000000b  byte 13
00000000b  byte 14
00000000b  byte 15
```

The full bitmap contains bitmaps for every character, thus it's 256*16 bytes, 4096 bytes long (for 8x16 fonts). If you want to get the bitmap for a specific character, you have to multiply the ASCII code by 16 (number of rows in a character for 8x16 fonts).

## What are these PSF files?

These PSFs ([PC Screen Font](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/font-formats-1.html)) were created using the bin2psf conversion tool from raw VGA ROM font dumps from various sources. These files are extemely small and suitable for embedded, memory limited or retro projects. The files are almost a raw dump of the VGA ROM font with just a few bytes for the header.

## What can I do with this?

Anything you want! You may use the file format or sourcecode for embedded, retro, game projects and more. This does not require you to have DOS or any old PC hardware. All code here is written for modern hardware. The font file format is super simple and the text rendering code is straightforward and clean. With very little effort, the rendering code can be ported to your favorite programming language and library. There are many example fonts in the `fonts` directory. I honestly do not know the orginal souces of these and highly recommend you to create your own fonts using this tool for your projects.
